    <h1>What I'm doing now</h1>
<p>Updated - April 8, 2023 from Pune, India</p>
<h2>Mussoorie Trip</h2>
<p>A week ago I returned from a long trip in Mussoorie. Along the way I met many wonderful people, had some great conversations and learned a lot.</p>
<h2>This website</h2>
<p>I have setup a basic website with <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">a 'now' page</a> (this page). For a quick and easy solution, I built it with 11ty, Water.css &amp; hosted it on Github Pages.</p>
<p>I read about the <a href="https://sive.rs/now" target="_blank">now</a> page on Derek Sivers website a long time ago, and recently came across <a href="https://moinaabdul.com/" target="_blank">Moina Abdul's</a> website and her now page. This inspired me to set this up.</p>
<h2>Music and Reading</h2>
<p>I have always wanted to learn a musical instrument, for the past month I have been learning to play the Ukelele. My goal for the next 2 months is to learn to play a couple of songs and be able to sing while strumming.</p>
<p>I recently finished reading <strong>Make Time</strong>, which made me understand among other things, the importance of using and maintaining a Calendar.</p>
<p>Thinking about reading only fiction books for this month. Still reading <strong>Station Eleven</strong> by Emily St. John Mandel.</p>
<h2>Tech and Career</h2>
<p>On the career front, I was working as a DevOps Consultant for a startup. Right now, I am learning more about containerization &amp; go.</p>
