# What I'm doing now

Updated - April 17, 2023 from Pune, India

## Trip to Musoorie

A few weeks ago I returned from a long trip in Mussoorie.

## This website

I have setup a basic website with <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">a 'now' page</a> (this page). For a quick and easy solution, I built it with 11ty, Water.css & hosted it on Github Pages.

I read about the <a href="https://sive.rs/now" target="_blank">now</a> page on Derek Sivers website a long time ago, and recently came across <a href="https://moinaabdul.com/" target="_blank">Moina Abdul's</a> website and her now page. This inspired me to set this up.

## Music and Reading

I have always wanted to learn a musical instrument, for the past month I have been learning to play the Ukelele. My goal for the next 2 months is to learn to play a couple of songs and be able to sing while strumming.

I recently finished reading **Make Time**, which made me understand among other things, the importance of using and maintaining a Calendar, which I haven't started doing anywayðŸ˜….

Finished **Station Eleven** by Emily St. John Mandel. Send me your book recommendations.


## Tech and Career

On the career front, I was working as a DevOps Consultant for a startup. Right now, I am learning more about containerization & go. Starting work on a few freelance projects soon.
