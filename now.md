# What I'm doing now

Updated - March 7, 2023 from Pune, India

## Music and Reading

I have always wanted to learn a musical instrument, for the past month I have been learning to play the Ukelele. My goal for the next 2 months is to learn to play a couple of songs and be able to sing while strumming.

I recently finished reading **Make Time**, which made me understand among other things, the importance of using and maintaining a Calendar. 

Thinking about reading only fiction books for this month. Started reading **Station Eleven** by Emily St. John Mandel.


## Career, OSS

On the career front, I was working as a DevOps Consultant for a startup. Right now, I am learning more about containerization & go.

Also, on the lookout for open-source projects in this space where I can contribute and learn more.


## Of Cats & Kittens

My cat gave birth to 3 kittens. We have been taking care of them for the past 2 months. Now, we are looking for people interested in adopting them. If you are interested in adopting a kitten in Pune/Mumbai, please reach out to me by email.
