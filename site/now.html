    <h1>What I'm doing now</h1>
<p>Updated - March 7, 2023 from Pune, India</p>
<h2>Music and Reading</h2>
<p>I have always wanted to learn a musical instrument, for the past month I have been learning to play the Ukelele. My goal for the next 2 months is to learn to play a couple of songs and be able to sing while strumming.</p>
<p>I recently finished reading <strong>Make Time</strong>, which made me understand among other things, the importance of using and maintaining a Calendar.</p>
<p>Thinking about reading only fiction books for this month. Started reading <strong>Station Eleven</strong> by Emily St. John Mandel.</p>
<h2>Career, OSS</h2>
<p>On the career front, I was working as a DevOps Consultant for a startup. Right now, I am learning more about containerization &amp; go.</p>
<p>Also, on the lookout for open-source projects in this space where I can contribute and learn more.</p>
<h2>Of Cats &amp; Kittens</h2>
<p>My cat gave birth to 3 kittens. We have been taking care of them for the past 2 months. Now, we are looking for people interested in adopting them. If you are interested in adopting a kitten in Pune/Mumbai, please reach out to me by email.</p>
